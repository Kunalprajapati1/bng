Ridesharing can be great fun, but sharing a ride with a stranger can be a bit daunting, especially if you have never done it before. To make sure you have an amazing experience we've put together some tips to keep you safe.

Facebook and social media profiles
Browsing social media profiles can give you a good idea of the other person's interests, friends and family. It can also be a good way to find out about the other person's personality, interests and if you share common ground. 

Read reviews
People can leave reviews on CoSeats so make sure you read them. Reviews are a great way to find out more about other people you want to share a ride with so please always leave reviews after you share a ride. The more reviews, the safer CoSeats will be for everyone.

Get to know the other person
We recommend meeting people you want to share a ride with in person before your trip. Choose a public place to meet up and get to know each other if possible. If you can't meet up beforehand, make sure you talk to the other person beforehand to make sure you have found a suitable rideshare buddy.

Establish some ground rules
Make sure you are both on the same page before you head off. Agree on your trip details such as the cost (including how and when you will pay); pick up and drop off times; breaks and sightseeing; is smoking allowed etc.

Trust your gut feeling
If there is anything that makes you feel uncomfortable about the other person, trust your instincts and find another ride. It’s better to be safe than sorry!


Share your plans with family and friends
Once you decide to share a ride, make sure to let friends or family know of your plans. Agree on check in points throughout the trip for your relative or friend to call you, and let them know when you intend on arriving at your destination.  If you arrange for someone to call you, be mindful that you may not have mobile phone coverage everywhere.

Driving license and number plate
Get a photo of the vehicle's number plate and ask if it's okay to also send a photo of the driver’s license to your friend or relative.

Public places for pick up and drop off
Keep your home, work or friends / family addresses private by arranging public pick up and drop off points.

Exchange contact details
We recommend exchanging emergency contact details beforehand with the person you're sharing a ride with. Make sure you also write down important numbers in case you don’t have access to your mobile.

Take your ID and some money
Always keep a credit or debit card, your ID and some cash with you in case you get stranded or separated from your driver for any reason.

Stay away from remote places
It is always safer to stay in public places, where there are other people to help in case of an emergency. For example, if you are going to be camping overnight, try to stay in a public campsite with other people rather than in a remote location with a stranger.

And last but not least... enjoy your trip!
